## Bugs which needs addressing
- you can open multiple windows of the extension.   
- the current window does not update when you change images.  
- the output file is not a ".json" file like with the built in classifier functions.   
- needs an image to be open for the window to show.   
- the comboBox for selecting measurements has unnecessary options
- More which I have not yet found
